# AI Usage Log

The Quantic rubric requires a log of how AI tools were used during this project.
Add an entry every time you use an AI assistant for something non-trivial. Both
team members log to the same file. Do this **as you go** — reconstructing it at
the end is painful and inaccurate.

Format per entry:

- **Date** — YYYY-MM-DD
- **Author** — your name
- **Tool** — Claude / ChatGPT / Cursor / Copilot / etc.
- **Task** — what you were trying to do
- **Prompt summary** — one sentence on what you asked
- **What the AI contributed** — concretely, what it produced or unblocked
- **What you learned / how you verified** — your own check or insight

## Entries

### 2026-05-04 — Jasper — Claude (Cowork mode)
- **Task:** Project framing + build plan.
- **Prompt summary:** Asked Claude to pick apart the project description, explain
  the gap between the stated NovaBank churn case and the UCI Bank Marketing
  dataset, and propose a framing that lets us use the real labels.
- **What the AI contributed:** Identified that the dataset is campaign-response
  data (not literal churn), proposed the "Predictive Retention via Targeted
  Engagement Campaigns" reframe, mapped each rubric line to a concrete
  deliverable, and flagged the `duration` leakage issue as a deliberate
  methodological move (build one leaky benchmark + one deployable model).
- **What I learned / how I verified:** Confirmed the leakage point against the
  dataset README (`bank-additional-names.txt`), which states `duration` is only
  known after the call ends and should not be used for realistic prediction.

### 2026-05-04 — Jasper — Claude (Cowork mode)
- **Task:** Scaffold the project.
- **Prompt summary:** Asked Claude to scaffold the full Python project structure
  for VS Code with notebook stubs, src/ modules, requirements.txt, and a README.
- **What the AI contributed:** Generated the folder layout, starter modules in
  `src/`, notebook stubs with rubric-mapped section headers, and this log
  template.
- **What I learned / how I verified:** Reviewed the structure against the
  Quantic step-by-step guidance in the project description; confirmed each step
  has a corresponding notebook.
